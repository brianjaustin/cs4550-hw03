Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Brian Austin

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
hw03.baustin-neu.site

3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Storing state with a Set instead of list resulted in React behaving
strangely (mostly just not rerendering components when it should).
Eventually I eneded up just going with a list and using Lodash
functions to enforce guess uniqueness, as noted in my source code.

4. What external libraries did you use? For what?
* Lodash - general untility functions (like uniq and shuffle)
* Milligram - to make things look prettier
* Chai - BDD-style expectations for unit testing in `game.js`
